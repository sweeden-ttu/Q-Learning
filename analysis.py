    What is your implementation strategy for Q-Learning in Phase 1?
    
    Default Implementation Analysis:
    The getValue and getPolicy methods in QLearningAgent are implemented as simple wrappers:
    - getValue(state) calls computeValueFromQValues(state), which returns the maximum Q-value over all legal actions
    - getPolicy(state) calls computeActionFromQValues(state), which returns the action with the maximum Q-value
    
    These methods delegate the actual computation to computeValueFromQValues and computeActionFromQValues,
    which I implemented. This abstraction allows ApproximateQAgent (Phase 4) to override getQValue to use
    feature-based Q-values while keeping getValue and getPolicy unchanged.
    
    Implementation Strategy:
    1. Initialize Q-values: Created self.qValues as a util.Counter() in __init__ to store Q(state, action) pairs.
       Counter defaults to 0 for unseen state-action pairs, which is perfect for Q-learning.
    
    2. getQValue(state, action): Returns the Q-value for a state-action pair from self.qValues.
       Since Counter defaults to 0, unseen pairs automatically return 0.0 as required.
    
    3. computeValueFromQValues(state): Computes V(s) = max_a Q(s,a) by:
       - Getting all legal actions for the state
       - Returning 0.0 if no legal actions (terminal state)
       - Otherwise, iterating through legal actions and finding the maximum Q-value using getQValue
    
    4. computeActionFromQValues(state): Computes the best action by:
       - Getting all legal actions
       - Returning None if no legal actions (terminal state)
       - Finding all actions with the maximum Q-value
       - Breaking ties randomly using random.choice() as specified in the instructions
    
    5. update(state, action, nextState, reward): Implements the Q-learning update rule:
       Q(s,a) = Q(s,a) + α * [R + γ * max_a' Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]
       Where:
       - α (self.alpha) is the learning rate
       - γ (self.discount) is the discount factor
       - R is the immediate reward
       - max_a' Q(s',a') is computed using getValue(nextState)
    
    Key Design Decisions:
    - Used getQValue and getValue instead of directly accessing qValues to maintain abstraction
    - This allows ApproximateQAgent to override getQValue without changing other methods
    - Random tie-breaking ensures better exploration and avoids deterministic suboptimal policies

    Default Implementation:
    - getValue(state) delegates to computeValueFromQValues(state) which returns max Q-value
    - getPolicy(state) delegates to computeActionFromQValues(state) which returns best action
    
    Implementation Strategy:
    1. Initialize Q-values as util.Counter() for automatic 0 defaults
    2. getQValue returns Q(state,action) from self.qValues
    3. computeValueFromQValues finds max Q-value over legal actions
    4. computeActionFromQValues finds best action with random tie-breaking
    5. update implements Q-learning: Q(s,a) = Q(s,a) + α[R + γV(s') - Q(s,a)]
